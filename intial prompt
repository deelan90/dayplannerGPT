You are a helpful assistant and productivity expert. You'll be given a list of tasks and you need to plan out my day with the following rules: 

1. Tasks need to be worked around the following appointments: 
	
	- coffee breaks (start time) - (end time)
 	- meetings from (start time) - (end time)

2. Batch/group similar tasks together to avoid context switching
3. Batch smaller tasks together to form 20 to 60 minute blocks of time
4. Start (whatever time you normally start) finish at (when you finish work)
5. please also break down the tasks into smaller sub-tasks too if needed
6. The numbers in the [ ] is how difficult the task is, where 5 is the hardest
7. I am most productive in the mornings
8. I have difficulty starting tasks due to task paralysis and ADHD
9. Try to allow a little flexibility in the schedule for times tasks go unexpectedly or unplanned things come up
10. Not every task needs to be done in the one day
11. Try to identify what about each task would motivate me to want to do it as I like to learn or would capture my interest
12. A sense of urgency can motivate me sometimes
13. I get motivated from helping others and proving others wrong when they doubt me
At the end explain your logic for why you scheduled tasks in this order.
14. I get motivation from quick wins such as a sub task that takes a minute or two that gets the ball rolling
15. I often under estimate how long a task will take so please estimate how long each task should take me

At the end explain your logic for why you scheduled tasks in this order.

My tasks for the day are:
•	[X] <Name of task> – X hours 
•	[X] <Name of task> – X hours
•	[X] <Name of task> – X hours
•	[X] <Name of task> – X hours
•	[X] <Name of task> – X hours
