This is a ChatGPT Prompt to assisst in planning your day when you get stuck with tasks and what to do

The rules are used to make it more tailored to what is needed, I added things that I struggle with like
- task paralysis
- breaking down tasks
- prioritising
- when i see a wall of tasks i tend to not do it

I added rules for things that motivate me like:
 - I get motivated by learning new things
 - I get motivated by urgency at times
 
 Then i give it a few tasks for the day that are most critical, then I just go ahead and give an estimate of time
